I want to synchronize employee termination between Workday and Salesfoce. 
This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of employee termination from Workday instance to Salesforce. Everytime there is a new employee termination, the integration will poll for changes in Workday source instance and it will be responsible for deactivating the User(if exists) on the target Salesforce instance.

			<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

1. **Users cannot be deleted in SalesForce:** For now, the only thing to do regarding users removal is disabling/deactivating them, but this won't make the username available for a new user.
2. **Each user needs to be associated to a Profile:** SalesForce's profiles are what define the permissions the user will have for manipulating data and other users. Each SalesForce account has its own profiles.
3. **Working with sandboxes for the same account**: Although each sandbox should be a completely different environment, Usernames cannot be repeated in different sandboxes, i.e. if you have a user with username *bob.dylan* in *sandbox A*, you will not be able to create another user with username *bob.dylan* in *sandbox B*.
4. **Workday e-mail uniqueness**: The e-mail can be repeated for two or more accounts (or missing). The template requires email uniqueness for the accounts.

			<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Users to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Users are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 11 api calls will be made (10 + 1).

		<![CDATA[
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented in this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml) everytime there is a new query executed asking for created/updated Employees.
2. During the Process stage, each Employee will be filtered depending on employee termination criteria and if it has an existing matching User in the Salesforce.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the Users and update them in Salesforce. Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.
